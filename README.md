This is my attempt at applying [this tutorial](https://wyag.thb.lt/). As the name suggests, it's a Git-like Version control system.
Mine is called (wmwyag) as in (writing myself a write yourself a git).
I've taken the liberty of copying and pasting from the tutorial, as my goal was to get a more hands-on understanding of how git works.
